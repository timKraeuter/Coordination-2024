# Coordination-2024
This repository contains the sources of [our paper](./paper.pdf) submitted to the [26th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (Coordination 2024)](https://www.discotec.org/2024/coordination) and associated [artifacts](artifacts/python-scripts/README.md).

# Methodology
The following queries were used for the **tertiary study**:

[Coordination language query](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=survey+OR+%22feature+model%22+OR+taxonomy+%22coordination+language%22&btnG=):
```
survey OR "feature model" OR taxonomy "coordination language"
```

[ADL query:](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=survey+OR+%22feature+model%22+OR+taxonomy+%22architecture+description+language%22&btnG=)
```
survey OR "feature model" OR taxonomy "architecture description language"
```

[Co-simulation query:](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=survey+OR+%22feature+model%22+OR+taxonomy+%22co+simulation%22&btnG=)
```
survey OR "feature model" OR taxonomy "co simulation"
```

# Feature model
The following figure shows the complete feature model.

# Artifacts
Our artifacts are described [here](./artifacts/python-scripts/README.md).
They contain all [data](./artifacts/classification.xlsx) from applying the feature model to the different approaches.
In addition, we provide our analysis scripts to do the approach clustering and generate related diagrams.
