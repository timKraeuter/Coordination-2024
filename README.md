# Application of the feature model
All data from applying the feature model to the 16 approaches can be found [here](./artifacts/classification.xlsx).


The python scripts to generate **venn diagrams** along with a step-by-step description is located [here](./artifacts/python-scripts/).
**Sample venn diagram:**
