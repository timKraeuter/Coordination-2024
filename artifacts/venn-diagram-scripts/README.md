# Generate venn diagram of the feature sets of three approaches

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a cmd/bash in this folder.
3. Run one of the following commands:
```bash
py Venn_3.py BCoordLang Linda MontiArc
```
Generates the **first venn diagram** in the paper.
See sample output diagram in `./BCoordLang_BCOol_MontiArc_venn.svg`.
The console outputs will **contain** which **features are overlapping/unique**.

```bash
py Venn_3.py BCoordLang DACCOSIM MontiArc
```
Generates the **second venn diagram** in the paper.
See sample output diagram in `./BCoordLang_DACCOSIM_MontiArc_venn.svg`.
The console outputs will **contain** which **features are overlapping/unique**.
